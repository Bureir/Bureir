## 📣 Source Code Policy

> Most of my work is private to protect intellectual property and maintain academic integrity.  
>  
> I **do not share sensitive source code publicly**, especially coursework or competitive designs. However, I'm happy to:  
> - Share proof of authorship and commit history  
> - Walk through projects live over a verified call  
> - Discuss design, test, and debug methodology

## 🛠️ Skills & Capabilities

**🔬 Architecture & RTL Design**  
- Superscalar, out-of-order, speculative execution pipelines  
- Tomasulo's algorithm, register renaming, CDB, PRF, ROB  
- Associative and non-blocking cache design (write-back, write-allocate)  
- RTL: **SystemVerilog**, **Verilog**, Chisel (exploring)

**🛠️ Hardware Design & Verification**  
- Synthesis, P&R, timing closure, static timing analysis

- Formal verification via **JasperGold**, plus UVM-style validation  
- CMOS and VLSI design techniques

**⚡ High-Performance Computing & Parallelism**  
- **CUDA** (shared memory tiling, coalesced access, INT8 quantization)  
- **OpenMP**, multithreading, low-latency pipelines  
- Real-time image/video processing on FPGAs (30 FPS @ high-res)

**🧠 Software & Simulation**  
- C/C++, Python, Bash, MATLAB, TCL, Perl  
- Embedded systems (Arduino, STM32, custom SoCs)  
- Web development (HTML/CSS/JS, Flask, Node, Firebase)  
- Linux internals, kernel mods, custom drivers, networking stacks  
- Database design, file system tweaking, cross-arch simulation

**🧰 Tools & Platforms**  
- Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys Verdi, Vivado, Quartus, SLURM, Makefiles  
- Git, GitHub, GitOps workflows, CI/CD  
- OS-native scripting (Linux, macOS, Windows PowerShell)

**🧩 AI/ML Hardware Optimization**

- INT8 quantization, CUDA tensor cores  
- 4x+ speedup over CPU baselines for real-time inference

**🧑‍🔬 Meta-Skills**  
- 🧠 **Extreme learning agility** — I pick up new stacks like I’ve been doing them for years  
- 🔧 **Builder’s instinct** — from fixing engines to optimizing memory subsystems  
- 💡 **Hyper-resourceful** — nothing gets blocked, everything gets solved  
- 🔥 **Full-stack to full-system** — I don't need a framework. I *am* the framework
