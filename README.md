# 👋 Hi, I'm Bureir Alaboudi

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan with a deep passion for:
- ⚙️ Low-level systems and computer architecture
- 🚀 High-performance computing (HPC)
- 🧠 Building from transistor to application
- 🧪 Tinkering with speculative execution, branch prediction, and cache optimization

I've built everything from custom RISC-V CPUs with out-of-order superscalar pipelines, to CUDA-tiled matrix engines, to debugging frameworks for real-time systems.

## 🔧 Current Projects

- **R5SEBA** – My custom 2-way out-of-order RISC-V processor with speculative execution, branch recovery, and associative caches
- **ConvoLite** – A CUDA-optimized deep learning engine with shared memory tiling
- **μTracker** – An RTL-based microarchitectural profiling framework with integrated testbenches and debug state dumpers

_(Contact me for live walkthroughs or private demonstrations)_
